Automagically set a sequentially numbered post title if you're too lazy to remember what number you're up to.

== Description ==

Automatically creates a sequentially numbered post title of your choosing if the
title is left blank when the post is published.  The plugin keeps track of what
number to use and increments the number every time you publish a post with a
blank title.  Additionally, the post slug/url will be updated to reflect the new
title if the author did not specify one manually.

An options page is available to set the title you want to use or to tweak the
incremental number, should it become necessary.  This plugin is *very* basic and
is **not** multi-user aware.  If *any* author on the site publishes a post with a
blank title, SequenTitle will do its song and dance.
